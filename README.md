# ConwaysGameOfLife
Simulation of "Conways Game of Life"

A Small Java program that generates a visible grid of 50x50 cells, randomly populates them and runs the simulation at 5 steps per second, these values can be adjusted in the WindowFrame file.

It uses a small rendering system that displays a Canvas and updates it at 30fps, because of this the steps per second shouldn't go past 30.
